# chat-socket
## Start:
+ Socket chat, with the main objective to study technologies like tcp / ip, threads, blockchain ..... And many other technologies.
## Goals:
+ The chat will be socket-based like file transfers,
+ Threads and asynchronism to not block processes,
+ Use of elctron and more web services for the front,
+ The back-end will be embedded in the user's machine, allowing that it is not necessary to use an intermediary (Server) for data transfers to be completed.
